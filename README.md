This is the starter project for Elisha Mugenyi

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
* `final` - Final project (StudentPay App).
# Overview

* #`final` - Final project (StudentPay App).

The software uses C# to make payments with virtual credit cards to university for students who do not have access to credit card. Since the banks worldwide can accomodate bank transfers, this App relies on that power to set up the student to top up their virtual card from any of their banks, then use the balance transfered to the card to make payments to the university.
The app works in such a way that, it allows the user to sign, login, create virtual card and exit the menu. Once signed in, the student can then use those details to login and access the payment console and go through the steps to make the payment.

This software was firt built some time back but it never performed as it should since the card was not possible to be created at the time, top it up and use it to make payments. The modifications to it have been solutions to those challenges the app had at first. Now, the card can be generated and saved on desktop, the student can top it up, use it to make payments and track their balance on it. Its flawless now as it was intended.
